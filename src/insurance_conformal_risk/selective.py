SelectiveRiskController: accept/reject risks to bound expected loss on accepted book.

The selective conformal risk control problem (arXiv 2512.12844, Selective Conformal
Risk Control): a two-stage approach where you first decide which risks to accept,
then guarantee that the accepted book has bounded expected loss.

In insurance underwriting terms: you have a risk scoring model that produces a
score s(X) for each risk. You want to:
1. Accept risks where s(X) >= threshold (the 'good' risks)
2. Guarantee that E[L(Y, d(X)) | risk is accepted] <= alpha

The difficulty is that naive thresholding on the calibration set is biased
(the risks you accept are not representative of the full population). The SCRC-I
algorithm from arXiv 2512.12844 handles this with a DKW-based correction.

This implementation follows SCRC-I (calibration-only, no refitting), which is
the correct approach for a pricing team that has a fixed underwriting model.

Lambda parameterisation: lambda is the acceptance threshold on the risk score.
Higher lambda = more restrictive selection = fewer policies accepted = lower
expected loss on accepted book (monotone).

The guarantee: if at least xi_min fraction of risks are selected (selection rate
constraint), then E[L | selected] <= alpha.

class SelectiveRiskController:
    """
    Two-stage risk control: selection then expected-loss guarantee.

    Implements SCRC-I from arXiv 2512.12844. The controller finds the
    lowest risk-score threshold such that the expected loss on accepted
    risks is at most alpha, subject to a minimum selection rate xi_min.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
        Target expected loss on accepted risks. Typical values: 0.05 to 0.20.
    loss_fn : callable
        Signature: loss_fn(y, scores) -> np.ndarray, shape (n,).
        Per-observation loss for accepted risks. Must return values in [0, B].
        Example: loss_fn = lambda y, scores: (y > threshold).astype(float)
    xi_min : float, default 0.5
        Minimum fraction of risks that must be accepted (selection rate floor).
        If the calibration set has 1000 observations, xi_min=0.5 means at least
        500 must be selected. This prevents the trivial solution of accepting
        zero risks.
    lambda_grid : np.ndarray or None
        Risk score thresholds to search over. If None, linearly spaced over
        the observed score range during calibrate(). Higher lambda = fewer
        accepted.
    B : float, default 1.0
        Upper bound on the loss function.
    delta : float, default 0.05
        Confidence level for the DKW-based correction on selection rate.
        The selection rate constraint holds with probability 1 - delta.

    Attributes
    ----------
    threshold_ : float
        Calibrated risk score threshold. Accept risk iff score >= threshold_.
    lambda_hat_ : float
        Same as threshold_, kept for API consistency with other controllers.
    n_calibration_ : int
    selection_rate_ : float
        Fraction of calibration set accepted at threshold_.
    is_calibrated_ : bool

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def high_claim_loss(y, scores):
    ...     return (y > 5000).astype(float)  # Loss = 1 if large claim
    >>> src = SelectiveRiskController(alpha=0.10, loss_fn=high_claim_loss, xi_min=0.6)
    >>> src.calibrate(y_cal, scores_cal)
    >>> decisions = src.predict(scores_new)
